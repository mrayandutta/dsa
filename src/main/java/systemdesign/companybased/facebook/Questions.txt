Write a function to return the number of times a character appears in a string. The character can be the empty string.
Complete a function that returns a list containing mismatched words in two strings. The return list can be in any order. I used set to solve this question, but was also asked to verbally explain how I would solve it without using sets.
Given an array containing None values, fill in the array with the most recent None value. If the list starts with None, then don't do anything to it.
Given a dictionary, print the key for nth highest value present in the dict. If there are more than 1 record present for nth highest value then sort
the key and print the first one (alphabetically). N can be higher than the number of elements in the dictionary.
Given a list of ints, balance the list so that each int appears equally in the list. Return a dictionary where the key is the int and the value is the count needed to balance the list.

[1, 1, 2] => {2: 1}
[1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 2, 2] => {5: 2, 3: 2, 2: 1}

Got an unpleasant past experience and inadequate feedback when interviewing with Facebook a few years back. This year got spammed by managers and HRs everywhere for about a month. Decided to give it a try again.

Eventually: “Despite a ton of positive feedback you didn’t hit the bar.”

Waste of time, people.

Data Engineer Interview
Anonymous Employee in New York, NY

Accepted Offer
Positive Experience
Average Interview
Application
I applied through an employee referral I interviewed at Meta (New York, NY) in Feb 2022

Interview
I started with a referral from a friend and got a call about a week later with the recruiter around the beginning of December, which was asking me to tell her about myself and telling me about the role. No technical questions were asked, but from what I've seen they do sometimes ask but they'll usually be general questions like "what's the difference between UNION and UNION ALL".

I took the technical screening around 2 weeks after, which was just 5 Python and 5 SQL questions in 50 minutes or so. They don't expect you to do all of them, and most people should be fine with 3-4 Python and SQL questions solved. 3 is considered a bit borderline, though. My interviewer seemed a bit distracted, and one of my Python solutions hinged on a super obscure Python function that he kept hinting at but that I'd never heard of. Granted, in retrospect that particular issue could be solved easily with a different approach in Python but I felt tunnel visioned by the hints.

I got the news that I had passed a few days later, and I had the Full Loop scheduled for early February. Seemed like a long gap, but I wanted to make sure I could properly prepare and the recruiter was very willing to accommodate for that. They provide you with a super comprehensive overview of each portion of the interview along with a lot of preparation material, and really seems like they want you to succeed. I prepared by going through all the material supplemented with Youtube videos on product sense and reading the Data Warehouse Toolkit by Kimball for data modeling. You only really need chapters 1 and 2, though. All of the interviewers were really nice, were willing to help if I got stuck, and sometimes it really felt more like discussing/brainstorming with them rather than being interviewed. They were all also excited to talk about their jobs, provided you had any time left over from each round.

The whole process was super transparent and took around 2 months, but mine was definitely on the longer side since it was slowed down by taking place at the end of the year and I had to reschedule an interview at one point. They got back to me after the full loop interview within half a week.

Interview Questions
Phone interview questions are just 5 Python and 5 SQL questions. Don't exactly remember the exact questions but it's going to be Leetcode easy for Python and medium-hard for SQL and in the same vein as the ones other people have posted.

Can't disclose questions for the full loop due to an NDA.
